## LiftLab
LiftLab is an engaging fitness social media application designed to connect individuals who share a passion for exercise and health. This platform encourages users to create and share workout routines and meal plans within a supportive online community so the collection of experience, between beginners and athletes, can produce an educational and motivational space. While fitness and nutrition are often separated between mobile apps, they both collectively play a key role in achieving long-term health and wellbeing, therefore LiftLab claims its market debut by filling the gap and providing the tools and community support necessary to encourage users to become more active.
